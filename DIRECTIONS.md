The specs for our SimpleComponent are as follows:

    In the components/SimpleComponent.js file, create a SimpleComponent component.

    The component should be declared as a class (instance of Component) so that it can carry state.

    The component should have a state property called mood that has a default value of happy.

    The component should simply render its current mood state to the page in a div.

    The component should implement a handleClick function that can serve as a callback to the <div>'s click event. When clicked, the component's mood should toggle between happy and sad states.
